/* ASSIGNMENT - 1 QUESTION-2
(THIS ASSIGNMENT IS TO MAKE FLOWCHARTS AND WRITE PSUEDOCODES, BUT I AM CODING THESE QUESTIONS)

Problem Statement - Draw a flowchart to take two numbers and print their GCD.
*/
import java.util.Scanner;
// We are going to calculate GCD using Euclidien Algorithm.
/*
The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows:
If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.  
If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.  
Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R)
Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)
